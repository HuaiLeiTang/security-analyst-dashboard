GPS,NMEA GPS,Carry-Off GPS Attack,CAPEC,628,['N/A'],['627'],['N/A'],"A common form of a GPS spoofing attack, commonly termed a carry-off attack begins with an adversary broadcasting signals synchronized with the genuine signals observed by the target receiver. The power of the counterfeit signals is then gradually increased and drawn away from the genuine signals. Over time, the adversary can carry the target away from their intended destination and toward a location chosen by the adversary. The target must be relying on valid GPS signal to perform critical operations. High Low Spoofing GPS signals and having a target receiver use them is not a trival task. A ""proof-of-concept"" attack was successfully performed in June, 2013, when the luxury yacht ""White Rose"" was misdirected with spoofed GPS signals from Monaco to the island of Rhodes by a group of aerospace engineering students from the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas in Austin. The students were aboard the yacht, allowing their spoofing equipment to gradually overpower the signal strengths of the actual GPS constellation satellites, altering the course of the yacht.

In environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished by the software itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the software uses too much power too quickly, then this could cause the device (and subsequently, the software) to stop functioning until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner because of increased power costs. Normal operation of an application will consume power. However, in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume more power than intended, using components such as: Display CPU Disk I/O GPS Sound Microphone USB interface Architecture and Design Availability DoS: Resource Consumption (Other) DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart The power source could be drained, causing the application - and the entire device - to cease functioning."
