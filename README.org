** About the paper

   - Title: Looking for a Black Cat in a Dark Room: Security Visualization for Cyber-Physical System Design and Analysis
   - Authors: Georgios Bakirtzis, Brandon J. Simon, Cody H. Fleming, Carl R. Elks

** Getting Started

	This project works in conjunction with [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]] & [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/graphml_export][graphml_export]]. 
	Security Analyst Dashboard acts as a user interface to use [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]] to find 

** Prerequisites

	Please look at the prequisites found in [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]]
    
	- Java JDK 8
	- Python 3.6.x

** Building and Running

	The following script will automatically initialize the cybok-cli submodule, compile the code, and run the code.
	
    Windows:
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	$./build_and_run.bat
	#+END_SRC

    GNU/Linux
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	$./build_and_run.sh
	#+END_SRC
	
	
** Usage
	
	The dashboard will run checking to make sure you have the correct Python version and that Cybok is installed correctly. It will close if either had an issue.
	On the first launch, you will be asked if you would like to update the cybok databases which is required for proper operation. This will take some time to complete.

|----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =CTRL+S= | save node positions of the selected graph to a file                                  |
| =CTRL+L= | load node positions of the selected graph from file                                  |
| =CTRL+E= | exports the selected graph as a .graphml file                                        |
| =CTRL+F= | freeze/unfreeze auto layout                                                          |
| =CTRL+G= | (attack vector space)  grows the current selection (selects the nodes related to it) |
| =CTRL+B= | (attack vector space) adds the selected nodes to the bucket                      |
| =CTRL+I= | (attack vector space) opens a panel with additional information of the selected node |
| =CTRL+A= | (bucket) selects all visible nodes                                                   |
| =DEL=    | deselects the current selection                                                      |
| =DEL=    | (bucket) removes all checked entries from the bucket                                 |
