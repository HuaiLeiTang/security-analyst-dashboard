** About the paper

   - Title: Looking for a Black Cat in a Dark Room: Security Visualization for Cyber-Physical System Design and Analysis
   - Authors: Georgios Bakirtzis, Brandon J. Simon, Cody H. Fleming, Carl R. Elks

** Getting Started

	This project works in conjunction with [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]] & [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/graphml_export][graphml_export]]. 
	Security Analyst Dashboard acts as a user interface to use [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]] to find 

** Prerequisites

	Please look at the prequisites found in [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]]
    
	- Java JDK 8
	- Python 3.6.x

** Building and Running

	The following script will automatically initialize the cybok-cli submodule, compile the code, and run the code.
	
    Windows:
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	$./build_and_run.bat
	#+END_SRC

    GNU/Linux
	#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	$./build_and_run.sh
	#+END_SRC
	
	
** Usage
	
	The dashboard will run checking to make sure you have the correct Python version and that Cybok is installed correctly. It will close if either had an issue.
	On the first launch, you will be asked if you would like to update the cybok databases which is required for proper operation. This will take some time to complete.
	
*** Features

**** GraphML Support

	The System Topology and specifications files use GraphML files.
	
	For the System Topology file, the required attributs to be included are.. "Entry Points", "Software", "Firmware", "Operating System", and "Device".
	
**** Topology GraphML File

	| Attribute 		| Description										|
	|-------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
	| Entry Points		| How external devices interacts with the system	|
	| Software			| What Software the node uses						|
	| Firmware			| What Firmware the node uses						|
	| Operating System	| What Operating System the node uses				|
	| Device			| The device name that the node is 					|
	
**** Specifications GraphML File

	| Attribute 	| Description											|
	|---------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
	| Type			| Type of requirement; Structure, Mission, or Function	|
	| Description	| Description of the requirement						|
	
	#+BEGIN_SRC xml
	<graphml>
		<key attr.name="Hardware" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d5"/>
		<key attr.name="Entry Points" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d4"/>
		<key attr.name="Software" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d3"/>
		<key attr.name="Firmware" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d2"/>
		<key attr.name="Operating System" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d1"/>
		<key attr.name="Device" attr.type="string" for="node" id="d0"/>
	</graphml>

	| =Show CVE= 		| Toggles the visibility of CVE attack vectors in the attack vector space and tree views.		|
	| =Add to Bucket= 	| Adds all the selected attack vectors to the bucket.											|
	| =Delete Attacks= 	| Deletes all the selected attack vectors.														|
